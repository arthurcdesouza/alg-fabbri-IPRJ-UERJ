In class I wrote hello.cpp
then compile using c++
explained why a.out is a useful default output name
then did the same thing with "make hello"

Then we asked AI this:
make @hello.cpp print a table of celsius to farenheit and kelvin

It did the changes but also more trash. It comitted without having to.

It also takes a long time and seems like it tested and compiled its own result 
a couple of times until it got it right
